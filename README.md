# AIDAAdmin server

AIDAAdmin is an all-in-one dashboard designed for hospital personnel use to view and manage hospital departments and services, work teams and their material, and general inventory. AIDAAdmin was created for use in Centro Hospitalar Universitário Santo António (Porto) and designed for integration with existing software applications.

This repository contains the server for the "Orgs" module of the AIDAAdmin application and is still under development.
